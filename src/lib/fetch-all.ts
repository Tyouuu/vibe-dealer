// Read every row of a query, not just the first thousand.
//
// This project's API returns at most 1,000 rows per request (max_rows) and cuts the
// rest off WITHOUT an error. A page that reads rows and then adds them up — a month's
// points, who is owed cards, how many are pending — is therefore right until the
// thousand-and-first row and quietly wrong after it, with nothing on screen to say so.
// Measured on the demo with 12,000 transactions: "this month's earnings" read RM 34,121
// where the real figure was RM 409,982, and a reconciliation compared against a third of
// the month's points.
//
// The page function is called with the inclusive row range to ask for. Give it a
// stable ORDER (an `.order('id')` tiebreaker at least): paging an unordered query can
// repeat or skip rows between requests.
//
//   const rows = await fetchAll((from, to) =>
//     supabase.from('transactions').select('points, status').eq('status', 'verified').order('id').range(from, to))
//
// For a plain total or a count, prefer a SQL aggregate or `head: true` — it moves one
// row instead of the whole table. This is for the places that genuinely need the rows.
